# üìÑ Invoice OCR (Enhanced) App for ERPNext v15 

This repository offers a significantly improved version of the Invoice OCR tool, originally created by [Mohtashim-1](https://github.com/Mohtashim-1/Invoice-OCR). It automates data extraction from scanned PDF or image invoices and creates Sales or Purchase Invoices in ERPNext using OCR. This module was optimised for Odoo default Vendor Bills and Customer Invoices especially if you want to migrate from Odoo to ERPNext and wants to keep all sales/purchase data. Even if your vendor and/or your customer is using Odoo, you can scan bills and invoices.

I shall be adding more format of invoices in future if required so. Contributions are welcomed. 

## üöÄ What's New in This Fork

- üîÅ Support for both Tesseract and optional PaddleOCR
- üßæ Smarter parsing with improved line-item and metadata extraction
- üåç Multi-language OCR (including Urdu, Arabic, etc.)
- üñºÔ∏è Advanced image preprocessing (deskewing, denoising, etc.)
- üì§ Flexible export options (JSON, CSV, or direct ERPNext integration)
- üß± Modular, extensible codebase with better logging and error handling

## üß† Core Logic Overview

The script defines a Frappe DocType `InvoiceUpload` that:

- Extracts text from uploaded PDFs or images using `pytesseract`
- Parses invoice data: number, date, totals, line-items
- Auto-creates draft Sales/Purchase Invoices in ERPNext
- Handles file processing errors with graceful logging

## üìÇ ERPNext DocType: Invoice Upload

| Field            | Description                                |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Party Type       | Customer / Supplier                        |
| File             | Attach scanned invoice                     |
| OCR Status       | Pending / Processing / Extracted / Failed  |
| Extracted Data   | Raw JSON of OCR output                     |
| Create Invoice   | Triggers invoice generation in ERPNext     |
